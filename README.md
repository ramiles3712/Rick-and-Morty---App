## 🏗️ Architecture & Design Pattern

![Architecture Diagram](./public/diagram.png)

### Component-Based Architecture

The application follows a modular **Component-Based Architecture**, ensuring reusability and separation of concerns.

- **`src/components/`**: Reusable UI elements (`CharacterCard`, `SearchBar`, `Loader`).
- **`src/pages/`**: View components representing routes (`Home`, `Characters`, `Episodes`).
- **`src/layouts/`**: Structure wrappers (`Layout`, `Navbar`, `Container`).

### Service Layer Pattern

API logic is decoupled from UI components using a **Service Layer**.

- **`src/services/api.js`**: Handles all Axios HTTP requests and error interceptors.

### Custom Hooks

Business logic and data fetching are encapsulated in **Custom Hooks**.

- **`useCharacters`**, **`useEpisodes`**, **`useLocations`**: Manage data state, loading, and errors.
- **`useTitle`**: Manages document head metadata for SEO.
